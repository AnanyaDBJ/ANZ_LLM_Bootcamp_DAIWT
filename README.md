# ANZ LLM Bootcamp Repo ðŸ§ 

This repo is for the ANZ LLM Bootcamp Series.

## Setup

This series of notebooks have been developed and tested on ML Runtime 13.2 GA Edition

For optimal performance, we recommend running on ```g5.4xlarge``` instances on AWS. 

On Databricks, you can select the Single Node instance type and select the runtime and infrastructure above. If you run into capacity issues, we have supplemented the notebooks with CPU editions. In this case, feel free to use ```i3.4xlarge``` or ```m``` series. Please note that this will not have optimal performance. 

### Further Reading and Learnings
